In this repository I'll upload everything related to my Research Internship Abroad (RIA) project. This internship started on 01/10/2019 and will end on 20/12/2019.

The goal is to build a Machine Learning (ML) based High Energy Physics (HEP) objects generator that is faster and more reliable than the state-of-the-art non-ML based generators that are most used nowadays. The main idea is to develop a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (ConVAE) network to achieve that goal.
